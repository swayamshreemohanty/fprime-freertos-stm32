/**
 * \brief required ping constants
 *
 * The topology autocoder requires a WARN and FATAL constant definition for each component that supports the health-ping
 * interface. These are expressed as enum constants placed in a namespace named for the component instance. These
 * are all placed in the PingEntries namespace.
 *
 * Each constant specifies how many missed pings are allowed before a WARNING_HI/FATAL event is triggered. In the
 * following example, the health component will emit a WARNING_HI event if the component instance cmdDisp does not
 * respond for 3 pings and will FATAL if responses are not received after a total of 5 pings.
 *
 * ```c++
 * namespace PingEntries {
 * namespace cmdDisp {
 *     enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 };
 * }
 * }
 * ```

 * definition is required by the autocoder and the contents of this object are otherwise opaque to the autocoder. The
 * contents are entirely up to the definition of the project. This deployment uses subtopologies.
