# LedBlinkerDeployment Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the LedBlinkerDeployment Application

In order to build the LedBlinkerDeployment application, or any other F´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd LedBlinkerDeployment
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the LedBlinkerDeployment application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd LedBlinkerDeployment
fprime-gds
```
